  Kroket installation instructions

These are the installation guidelines for kroket.


REQUIREMENTS

 The only dependency on which Kroket relies is the Qt library.
 It is installed by default on most of (GNU)Linux distributions.
 Make sure you have the development packages (notably qmake) of Qt
 before trying to compile Kroket.


HOW TO PROCEED

 Well, it's pretty simple:

 $ qmake

 This will generate the Makefiles. You may modify the compiler's flags
 by editing the last lines of `kroket.pro'.

 $ make

 This will build Kroket.
 When done, you can eventually copy the generated executable in a bin directory.

 $ cp kroket ~/.local/bin
 $ sudo cp kroket /usr/bin

 Or anything like that should do.
